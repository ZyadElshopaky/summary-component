# Results Summary Component

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a results summary component inspired by the Frontend Mentor challenge. The component displays a user's test scores in a visually appealing format, highlighting individual categories and providing a summary of their overall performance.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The component adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Visual Appeal**: Uses gradients, icons, and color-coded sections to enhance visual presentation.
- **User Feedback**: Displays the user's score compared to peers, along with individual category scores.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the component.

## File Structure

## Usage

### HTML

The main structure of the component is built in the `index.html` file. It contains:

- A **container** for the card layout.
- A **Pro section** that shows the overall score.
- An **info section** that lists the scores for different categories.

### CSS

The styles are defined in `main.css`, using a combination of:

- CSS variables for colors and dimensions.
- Media queries for responsive design.
- Flexbox for layout arrangements.

## Customization

- To change the colors, modify the CSS variables in the `:root` section of `main.css`.
- Update the text and scores directly in the `index.html` file to reflect different results or user information.
- You can add more categories by duplicating the existing list items in the summary section.
